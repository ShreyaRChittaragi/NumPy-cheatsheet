## 🌟 Why NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the backbone of scientific computing in Python. It's blazing fast, memory efficient, and lets you perform matrix operations, statistical analysis, broadcasting, and much more.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 📌 Array Creation
```python
import numpy as np

np.array([1, 2, 3])             # Basic 1D array
np.zeros((2, 3))                # 2x3 matrix of zeros
np.ones((3, 1))                 # 3x1 column of ones
np.full((2, 2), 7)              # Filled with sevens
np.eye(3)                       # Identity matrix
np.arange(0, 10, 2)             # Evenly spaced values
np.linspace(0, 1, 5)            # 5 values from 0 to 1
```

### 🔍 Array Indexing & Slicing
```python
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])
arr[0]          # First element
arr[-1]         # Last element
arr[1:3]        # Slice
arr[arr > 20]   # Boolean indexing
```

### 🔧 Shape Manipulation
```python
arr = np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3)
arr.T                       # Transpose
arr.flatten()               # Flatten to 1D
arr.reshape(1, -1)          # Row vector
```

---

## 🧮 Mathematical Operations

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b   # Element-wise ops
np.dot(a, b)                 # Dot product
np.sqrt(a), np.exp(b)       # Element-wise functions
```

---

## 📏 Statistics & Aggregation

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
arr.sum(), arr.mean(), arr.std()
arr.max(), arr.min(), arr.argmin()
np.median(arr), np.percentile(arr, 75)
```

---

## 🚀 Broadcasting & Vectorization

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = 2
a * b             # Vectorized (multiplies each element by 2)

m = np.ones((3, 3))
v = np.array([1, 2, 3])
m + v             # Broadcasting
```

**✅ Explanation**: NumPy automatically "broadcasts" smaller arrays across larger ones when dimensions align.

---

## 🔁 Iteration & Logic

```python
np.where(arr > 2, 1, 0)          # Replace conditionally
np.any(arr > 0), np.all(arr > 0)
for val in np.nditer(arr): print(val)
```

---

## 📦 Advanced NumPy

```python
a = np.random.rand(3, 3)
np.linalg.inv(a)                # Matrix inverse
np.linalg.det(a)                # Determinant
np.einsum('ij,jk->ik', a, b)    # Einstein summation
np.save('array.npy', a)         # Save
np.load('array.npy')            # Load
```
